**Task**

To test this hypothesis, BCG will collect and preprocess data on SME customers' consumption patterns, billing histories, and demographic details, among other factors, and engineer new features relevant to predicting churn. BCG will then train a predictive model to predict the likelihood of churn for each SME customer, and use the predictions to test the effectiveness of a 20% discount strategy in reducing churn among high-churning customers. The performance of the predictive model and the effectiveness of the discount strategy will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and lift.
